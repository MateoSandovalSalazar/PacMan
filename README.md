# PacMen Exercise

## Description of Project
This project animates a Pac-Man image that moves back and forth across the screen, 
changing its direction upon hitting the edges of the screen. It simulates the classic arcade game character Pac-Man in a fun and interactive way.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
- Introduce more Pac-Man characters with varying animations.
- Add user controls to start, pause, and reset the animation.
- Implement obstacles that Pac-Men must navigate around.
